# Compendium of CIN repository hub

## Structure and content of the five repositories associated with this study

This repository works as the central code hub for "A pan-cancer compendium of chromosomal instability", Drews et al. (2022). It contains all code necessary to reproduce the figures (main, extended and supplement). Linked to this repository are four other repositories which contain methods that were used during this study, but they can also be adapted to be used by others on their own data. These are:
  <!---* [Signature discovery](https://github.com/markowetzlab/SignatureDiscovery)-->

  * [Signature discovery](https://github.com/markowetzlab/CINSignatureDiscovery)

   This repository contains code to identify pan-cancer signatures of CIN. The approach takes ASCAT copy number profiles as input and generates the final signature definitions and activities.

  <!---* * [Signature quantification](https://github.com/markowetzlab/SignatureQuantification)-->

  * [Signature quantification](https://github.com/markowetzlab/CINSignatureQuantification)

   This repository contains code to quantify CIN signatures given an absolute copy number profile.

  <!--- * [Signature interpretation](https://github.com/macintyrelab/SignatureInterpretation) -->

  * [Signature interpretation](https://github.com/macintyrelab/CINSignatureInterpretationMatrix)

   This repository contains code to generate the signature interpretation matrix which is used to assist in determining signature aetiologies.

  <!--- * [Genome simulation](https://github.com/markowetzlab/CINGenomeSimulation) -->

  * [Genome simulation](https://github.com/markowetzlab/CINSignatureGenomeSimulation)

   This repository contains code to simulate CIN producing mechanism by generating copy number profiles. From these profiles, signatures can be identified and compared to the expected signatures.
